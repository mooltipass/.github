# Mooltipass Current Status and Future Goals
At the time of writing (05/05/2023), the Mooltipass team is currently working on fixing bugs reported through the different repository issues tabs. Two important tasks are investigating possible 002 issues and integrating a contributor-made iOS app into our ecosystem.  
<b>Contributors are strongly welcome</b> to improve our ecosystem. The Mooltipass only exists because so many people from around the globe joined together to create three different devices over the last 9 years.

# New Mooltipass Device
At the time of writing (05/05/2023), making a new Mooltipass device isn't a priority as the team prefers concentrating its development efforts on adding features to the Mini BLE. However, some effort is currently being spent on exploring new secure elements.
